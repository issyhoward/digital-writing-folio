### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?

- Poetry, creative nonfiction, essays


### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

- journal & notebook, typing: word, onenote, i like to write directly after reading poetry/inbetween reading poems
- i like to write whilst i'm outside, typing into my notes app or writing into my journal
- i like to transfer poems from the written page, revising them on a document, sometimes transfering the final poem back onto paper
- i like to go through my journal/photos, taking inspiration from moments i have already attempted to capture


### Why do you use these tools or techniques?

- i think it most stimulates my creativity. i like the motion of writing when i am first constructing an idea, i like to feel that i am physically manifesting the thought or idea from my head onto paper. I then find it easier to revise and reform the poem digitally for ease and also for better accuracy. I like that i can easily search whilst writing, allowing the poem to become deeper and more evolved. 


### How do these tools shape the way you write?

- Allows it to be grounded, intentional and intuitive. Also quite habitual.
- Follows a similiar pattern, becomes habitual // less innovative. Keeps quite traditional & within my comfort zone. Percieved one way by the reader, less imput from the reader. Exists in one way only.
